# Description
This cookbook was originally forked from [bryanwb/cookbooks-vagrant-ohai](https://github.com/bryanwb/cookbooks-vagrant-ohai).
Unlike the original, this cookbook adds support for Ohai7+ plugins as the format changed.

More updates (tests, etc.) to come soon.

### Original Readme
Copy of opscode ohai cookbook, for specifically tweaking ipaddresses for vagrant nodes.
